# AIC-Quant
## Howdy! This is the repository of the AIC Quant Team.


This repository is meant to host many things, with a main focus on current iterations of strategies and data.
The goal of this team is first and foremost to be challenged, and learn from challenges that come with developing trading strategies.
Right now we have two strategies and are working on a Monte Carlo permutaitons generator, as well as a market levels bot
