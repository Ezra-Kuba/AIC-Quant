The Search Trends Anomaly Detector algo (STAD) primarily finds meaningful spikes or trends in search
traffic for a company that could be considered anomalous when compared to the actual stock price.

This algo is mainly for finding information 'arbitrage' when a company seems to be getting more 
attention (consumer-related) without a proper adjustment in stock price. This could be utilized by 
predicting if companies detected have strong consumer trends that will outperform their 'priced-in' 
growth and will be fully realized by their quarterly earnings report when the information about how well they did is released. 

That said using this to trade earnings seems like the best use-case but be mindful about how some search traffic doesn't necessarily correlate to higher sales or other positive metrics. 

The data pipeline is intended to collect and refine the necessary data for processing 
    - The iShares-russel-3000-etf_fund.csv was mainly to get the names of the companies
    - The search data is stored in trends_data.csv and is currently from past 3 months (im thinking of doing longer time for training but will update later)

I want to make the algo use the search trends data in tandem with the closing price of a company's stock
to assess the probability that there is an arbitrage opportunity. So far limiting the data 
to consumer-discretionary stocks for now because of the consumer-oriented nature of their performance.
Also its just using a SMA from the trends data to detect anomalies which leaves room for improvement (could use a ML model)
