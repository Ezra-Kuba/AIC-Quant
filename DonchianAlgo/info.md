#this strategy use two indicators as of now, ADX and Donchian Channels, to look for trends in markets.

##The donchian channel is a very simple technical indicator. It makes two bands, upper and lower, the high and low of a certain
period of lookback, respectively. If the stock is trading outside of these bands, it tells us a possible trend is forming.

However, that is obviously not enough on its own. So, in order to have a stronger gague for possible trends, we also use
the ADX technical indicator. ADX stands for Average Directional Index. Essentially, it measures the strength of a trend,
but does NOT tell you direction. The formulas are pretty straightforward, using only recnent info to make the value.

The strategy is as follows. If we are trading both above (below) the upper (lower) band and the ADX is > 25, we buy (short).
While we are not in the market, we invest back into the S&P. Why? It gurantees that we are at least matching the S&P in
those times, which is what we want to be doing.
